Data Science made using PHP

### Infographics [0]

* Data Science made using PHP, which scrapes the Facebook Name, Possibly Facebook Email Address (if set to Public) and Facebook User ID using Rabbit Hole Algorithm. Rabbit Hole is a Prediction Algorithm which uses Web Scraping and Machine Learning to predict User Changes on Facebook. Made on Mid of 2020 as a Cyber Security Tool for Analyzing Facebook Name changes on your Friend's List.

### Working?
* As of 2021 till 2022 and on-wards, The App is already obsolete, As you cannot fetch your Access Token directly without using an App and thus even with an Access Token you cannot data mine every possible Facebook Name, Email Address and UID from this Toolkit. This is just a clear representation of the Data Mining from Facebook's Platform.
