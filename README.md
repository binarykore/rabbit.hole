# Rabbit Hole
Data Science made using PHP

### Infographics [0]

* Data Science made using PHP, which scrapes the Facebook Name, Possibly Facebook Email Address (if set to Public) and Facebook User ID using Rabbit Hole Algorithm. Rabbit Hole is a Prediction Algorithm which uses Web Scraping and Machine Learning to predict User Changes on Facebook. Made on Mid of 2020 as a Cyber Security Tool for Analyzing Facebook Name changes on your Friend's List.

### Working for Data Science [0]?
* As of 2021 till 2022 and on-wards, The App is already obsolete, As you cannot fetch your Access Token directly without using an App and thus even with an Access Token you cannot data mine every possible Facebook Name, Email Address and UID from this Toolkit. This is just a clear representation of the Data Mining from Facebook's Platform.

### Real-Time usage for Data Science?
* It can be used on your Apps someday, such as ID and Profile Name, wherein a specific user will be notified in his Profile for Changes. As Facebook has shut its Doors on Cyber Security concerns. You can recreate the Rabbit Hole Algorithm as part of Web Scraping on admin-side of your own Platform.
